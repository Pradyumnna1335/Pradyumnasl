[00:02, 24/10/2024] Pradyumna Mannur: he Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first digraph substitution cipher. Instead of encrypting one letter at a time like simple substitution ciphers (e.g., Caesar cipher), Playfair encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), which makes it more secure by complicating frequency analysis.

Key Concepts:
Polygraphic Cipher: Unlike monoalphabetic ciphers that encrypt individual letters, Playfair encrypts digraphs (two-letter groups), increasing security.
Key Table: A 5x5 matrix of letters is used as the encryption key. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, one letter (usually 'J') is often omitted or combined with another letter ('I').
Steps for Encryption:

The Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first digraph substitution cipher. Instead of encrypting one letter at a time like simple substitution ciphers (e.g., Caesar cipher), Playfair encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), which makes it more secure by complicating frequency analysis.

Key Concepts:
Polygraphic Cipher: Unlike monoalphabetic ciphers that encrypt individual letters, Playfair encrypts digraphs (two-letter groups), increasing security.
Key Table: A 5x5 matrix of letters is used as the encryption key. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, one letter (usually 'J') is often omitted or combined with another letter ('I').
Steps for Encryption:
Generate the Key Table:

Choose a keyword, remove duplicate letters, and fill the matrix row-wise with the keyword's letters.
Fill in the remaining empty spaces with the rest of the alphabet (except for 'J' or whichever letter is omitted).
For example, using the keyword "MONARCHY", the table would look like this:

mathematica
Copy code
M O N A R
C H Y B D
E F G I K
L P Q S T
U V W X Z
Preparing the Plaintext:

Split the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of two letters). If the plaintext has an odd number of characters, add a filler letter (like 'X').
Ensure no digraph has two of the same letters. If a pair like "LL" occurs, insert a filler like 'X' between them, making it "LX."
For example, for the plaintext "HELLO", you would split it into:

mathematica
Copy code
HE LL O -> HE LX LO
Encrypting the Digraphs: The encryption rules for the Playfair cipher are based on the positions of the two letters in the key matrix:

Same Row: If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the letter immediately to its right (wrapping around to the start of the row if necessary).
Same Column: If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the letter immediately below it (wrapping around to the top of the column if necessary).
Rectangle: If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters on the same row but at the opposite corners of the rectangle.
Decryption: The decryption process is similar to encryption but reversed:

For letters in the same row, move left instead of right.
For letters in the same column, move up instead of down.
For letters forming a rectangle, follow the same process as encryption.
Example:
Let’s encrypt the digraph "HE" using the key matrix above:

H is in row 2, column 2.
E is in row 3, column 1.
They form a rectangle, so we replace them with the letters at the opposite corners of the rectangle, i.e., C (row 2, column 1) and I (row 3, column 2). Therefore, "HE" becomes "CI".
