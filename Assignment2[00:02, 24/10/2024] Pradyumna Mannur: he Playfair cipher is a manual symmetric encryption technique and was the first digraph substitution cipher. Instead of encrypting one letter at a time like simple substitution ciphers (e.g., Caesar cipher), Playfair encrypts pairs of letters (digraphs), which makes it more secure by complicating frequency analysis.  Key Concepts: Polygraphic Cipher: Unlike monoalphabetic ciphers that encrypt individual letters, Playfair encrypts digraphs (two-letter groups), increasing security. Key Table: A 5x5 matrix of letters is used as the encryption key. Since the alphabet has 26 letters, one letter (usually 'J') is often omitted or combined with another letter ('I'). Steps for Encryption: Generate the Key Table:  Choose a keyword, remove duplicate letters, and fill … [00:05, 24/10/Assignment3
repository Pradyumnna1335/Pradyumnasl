Block Cipher Modes of operation


AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that operates on blocks of data. While the AES algorithm itself specifies how data is encrypted, the modes of operation define how these blocks are processed to securely encrypt larger amounts of data. Each mode has its own characteristics, advantages, and drawbacks.


1. Electronic Codebook (ECB)



- Description: In the ECB mode, the plaintext is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted independently using the same key. If two identical plaintext blocks occur, they will produce the same ciphertext block.


- Advantages:

- Fast encryption and decryption.

- Suitable for encrypting small data sets.


- Disadvantages:

- Security Issues: Identical plaintext blocks yield identical ciphertext blocks, making patterns visible. This means ECB does not hide data patterns effectively.

- Not suitable for encrypting large amounts of data or sensitive information, as it can be vulnerable to certain attacks (e.g., frequency analysis).

1. Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)




- Description: In CBC mode, each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This means that each ciphertext block depends on all previous blocks, adding a layer of security.


- Characteristics:

- Requires an initialization vector (IV) to ensure that the same plaintext produces different ciphertext when encrypted multiple times.

- Sequential processing: Each block must be processed in order.


- Advantages:

- More secure than ECB because identical plaintext blocks will produce different ciphertext blocks due to the chaining effect.

- Hides patterns in the plaintext.


- Disadvantages:

- Sequential Processing: Cannot easily parallelize the encryption process since each block depends on the previous one, which can slow down performance.

- If the IV is not chosen correctly, it can weaken security.

2. Counter (CTR) Mode




- Description: CTR mode converts a block cipher into a stream cipher. It encrypts a counter value (which changes with each block) rather than the plaintext directly. The counter is typically initialized with a nonce (a number used only once), and it increments for each block of plaintext.


- Characteristics:

- Allows for parallel processing of blocks.

- Requires both a nonce and a counter.


- Advantages:

- Parallelizable: Blocks can be encrypted and decrypted independently, leading to faster processing.

- Efficient for encrypting streams of data or large data sets.

- More flexible than CBC and can handle random access to encrypted data.


- Disadvantages:

- If the same nonce and counter combination is reused, it can lead to vulnerabilities, potentially allowing attackers to recover plaintext.

3. Output Feedback (OFB) Mode




- Description: OFB mode turns a block cipher into a synchronous stream cipher. It generates keystream blocks by repeatedly encrypting an initial value (IV or nonce). This keystream is then XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext.


- Characteristics:

- The keystream is independent of the plaintext, allowing encryption and decryption to be performed in parallel.


- Advantages:

- Can operate in a streaming manner, making it suitable for real-time applications.

- Errors in one block do not propagate to subsequent blocks, as in CBC mode.


- Disadvantages:

- Keystream Reuse: If the same keystream is reused (e.g., by using the same IV), it can lead to vulnerabilities similar to CTR mode.

- Less efficient than CTR when encrypting large volumes of data, as it requires the generation of keystream blocks ahead of time.
